# Awesome-Technical-Books

A common question I get from bootcamp students or people interested in learning to code is, do you have any book recommendations? I don't use books a ton myself anymore, but I do enjoy them and I'm happy to share a few recommendations. If I'm missing any that you think should be on this list, feel free to open an issue and let me know. These suggestions are oriented for beginners, since that's who I come in contact with the most. Here goes:




  1. Eloquent Javascript - free online, or purchase a hardcopy

  1. Head First Java from O'Reilly
